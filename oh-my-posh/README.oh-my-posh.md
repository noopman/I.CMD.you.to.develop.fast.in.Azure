# Noopman oh-my-posh configuration

This folder contains my current oh-my-posh configuration. It is a copy of the file Scott Hanselman used, and then tweeked to fit my own needs. I don't love when the posh line has too many different colours. Some love that, fine, but I prefer a more stable coloring.

On the Cmd-Line, when you have installed oh-my-posh, you can run

Get-PoshThemes # to see all the themes available on your machine.

Go here for a multitude of themes and pick one you like:
